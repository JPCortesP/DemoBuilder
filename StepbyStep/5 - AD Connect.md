## AD Connect Setup

If you've been following these steps correctly (when in doubt, correctly means what I said) you'll have at least 3 users:

| User | origin | reason|
|-------|------|--------|
|YoursSomething | Entra ID Global Admin | Created when you got the Sub|
|Creation User (Iluvatar)|VMs and Active Directory creator user | Created by DC01 and promoted as semi-god by Creating an AD with it|
|yourname (JP)|Active Directory|Manually created by your creator user|

To make things even more simpler, we will stop using the Iluvatar-equivalent user here.

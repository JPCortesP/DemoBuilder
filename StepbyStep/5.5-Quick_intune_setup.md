## Required Intune Setup

To have things nicely done, we are going to do a couple of quick settings on Intune. If you have already done some stuff in Intune, you can safely ignore these steps, or mix them up with your own. 

### Adding GSA client to Intune. 
Althought this is quite simple, we are going to skip this phase and use a pre-packaged client. This will get out of date eventually, so you can [follow the steps here to re-package it yourself next time](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-windows-client#prerequisites). 

_The pre-packaged binary should be available to download from the binary folder on this repo. [Find it here](https://github.com/JPCortesP/DemoBuilder/releases/tag/v0.0.alpha.1)_

With the intunewin file, go to Intune Portal, and follow the steps on [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-windows-client#install-the-global-secure-access-client), **starting from the Deploy Global Secure Access Client with Intune**, stopping at the Update the client to a newer version. ![alt text](/screenshots/Article.png)

6. Click Save a couple of times. Now you can go and continue your W11 process.
